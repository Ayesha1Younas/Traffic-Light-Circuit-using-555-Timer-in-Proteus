Proteus Simulation for Traffic Light Circuit using 555 Timer 
This project has a complete and easy to understand circuit that is used in the Traffic Lights. The circuit uses 555 timer to have the uniform pulses of current so that each LED gets the current on a specific time and hence shows the signal.
